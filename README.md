# 💝 Valentine's Day Website

A fun, interactive website to ask someone special to be your Valentine!

## 🚀 How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it whatever you like (e.g., `v-day`, `valentine-surprise`)
3. **Don't** initialize it with a README (we already have files)

### Step 2: Push Your Code
Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** (top right)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** (in the left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **main** branch
5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Share the Link!
After a few minutes, your site will be live at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/
```
